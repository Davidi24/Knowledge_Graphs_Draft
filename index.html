        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A knowledge graph is a data structure that represents entities and their relationships in a graph format,
            enabling more efficient information retrieval and reasoning. They have two main components: <b>nodes</b>,
            which
            represent entities, and <b>edges</b>, which define the relationships between those entities. This allows the
            development of information
            networks that are
            meaningful in the real world. The goal in such an approach is, therefore, to develop a higher ranking from
            simply isolated keywords, with the meaning of the data system placed in context. Their relevance is
            significantly increased by integrating data across different formats and domains, making it easier to enable
            semantic search, improve decision-making, and support data merging applications. They find wide application
            in artificial intelligence, web development, e-commerce, and more, as they provide better insights and
            meaningful relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history of knowledge graphs began in 1972, when the concept was introduced as a way to structure and
            organize information. Earlier projects, including WordNet (1985) and Geonames (2005), mapped word meanings
            to contextual data with establishing links to geographic locations. In 2007, the game-changers DBpedia and
            Freebase expanded the knowledge graph approach by creating very large networks of interconnected data. The
            turning point came in 2012, when Google integrated knowledge graphs into its search engine, enabling smarter
            and more contextual search results. Since then, knowledge graphs have grown in importance, offering scalable
            solutions for managing and understanding the ever-increasing complexity of modern data systems. Big
            corporations like Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft have embraced the versatility of knowledge graphs to
            efficiently manage the massive amounts of data they generate and work with daily.

        <h2>2. Key Features of Knowledge Graphs</h2>
        <h4>2.1 Why Knowledge Graphs?</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for managing large amounts of data. They are flexible and can grow as
            data increases, making them great for handling complex information. They organize and connect data into one
            system, fixing errors like duplicates and missing information. Knowledge graphs also use logical thinking to
            fill in gaps in the data. Their structure helps group and classify information, making systems smarter and
            more efficient. These features are useful in areas like web engineering and artificial intelligence, helping
            to improve navigation, personalization, and content delivery.

        </p>
        <h4>2.2 Advantages of Knowledge Graphs</h4>
        <p>
            One big advantage of knowledge graphs is that they can handle growing data without problems. They organize
            information into a simple and clear structure, making it easier to use. They also find and fix mistakes,
            like repeated or missing data, while filling gaps with logical solutions. Their layered structure helps sort
            and group information better, improving how systems work. This makes them valuable in areas like web
            engineering and artificial intelligence, where they make navigation smarter, personalization better, and
            content delivery faster.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Taxonomy and Ontology in Knowledge Graphs</h2>
        <h4>3.1 Taxonomy</h4>
        <p>
            Taxonomy is the fundamental basis for knowledge graphs, which gives it a hierarchical structure that encodes
            entities in parent-child relationships. This model allows entities to be classified into more general or
            specific categories, or even individual items, thus creating an organized hierarchy of data.
            For example, in the knowledge graph of an e-commerce platform, “Electronics” is the parent category and
            “Smartphones” is its
            child category. Hierarchical data structure through the use of categories simplifies the data retrieval
            operation and could not be a better way for users to browse very large data sets. Taxonomies are very
            suitable for various tasks such as segmentation and filtering, as they provide a solid framework for
            understanding the relationships between entities. Having a clear and intuitive way to present data helps
            users find what they need, and thus, taxonomies excel in applications such as product recommendations or
            knowledge discovery. 
        </p>
        <h4>3.2 Ontology</h4>
        <p>
            The ontology in knowledge graphs builds on taxonomy by defining not only hierarchical relationships but also
            properties, rules, and connections between entities. Unlike taxonomies, which focus on classification,
            ontologies add semantic depth that enables complex reasoning and advanced queries. For example, an ontology
            might define that a “Smartphone” is a type of “Electronics” and include relationships such as “has features”
            (e.g. “has features: 5G support”) or “is compatible with” (e.g. “is compatible with: wireless charging”).
            This allows systems to extract new information, such as identifying all smartphones that support 5G and
            wireless charging, enabling smarter, more context-aware decision-making. Ontologies are key to integrating
            disparate data sources and are essential for applications such as artificial intelligence, where
            understanding the context of data is critical for automation and intelligent responses.
        </p>
        <h4>3.3 Combining Taxonomy and Ontology</h4>
        <p>
            Taxonomy helps organize, combine, and connect entities, while ontology adds a semantic layer that gives
            these structures meaning. Together, they form a powerful framework for advanced data organization and
            reasoning. Let's say in a healthcare we use knowledge graph. For this, taxonomy can classify entities such
            as "Disease" and "Treatment" are examples, while ontology is used to define relationships such as when
            "treatment is caused by". This makes it possible for computers to answer difficult questions such as, for
            example, which diseases can be treated with which treatments or which symptoms are associated with certain
            conditions. Knowledge graphs bring together concepts from areas like ontology and semantic networks. They
            offer a way to manage complex data sets independently from the systems that use them, focusing on organizing
            the data and giving it meaningful context. This combination of taxonomy and ontology is why
            knowledge graphs are so important for managing data in a complex environment. Thus, their collaboration
            leads to smooth and efficient data integration, accurate results in search engines, and creativity in
            building innovative applications in the fields of web engineering, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence.

        <h2>4. Optimizing Data Integration with Knowledge Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in optimizing data integration, especially in web engineering, where
            bringing together diverse data sources into a unified framework is essential. They provide a unified
            representation of data by merging disparate sources, eliminating duplication, and ensuring accuracy.
            By incorporating ontology and taxonomy, knowledge graphs add contextual meaning to data, enabling advanced
            queries and logical reasoning. Their adaptability to evolving data flows makes them well-suited for
            real-time applications. Furthermore, through features such as semantic search and personalized
            recommendations, knowledge graphs improve the user experience, creating intuitive and user-centric web
            interfaces.
        </p>

        <h4>A Systematic Review of Knowledge Graphs used for data integration in Web Engineering</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs have become an essential tool for data integration in web engineering, offering structured
            relationships between diverse datasets to enhance functionality and user experiences. They are widely
            applied in areas such as semantic search, personalized recommendations, dynamic content updates, and data
            visualization. By unifying disparate data sources, knowledge graphs provide seamless data merging, enhanced
            contextual understanding, and scalability, enabling improved decision-making for developers and businesses
            alike.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite their numerous benefits, implementing knowledge graphs poses challenges such as data quality issues,
            complex ontology design, and integration overhead. Solutions like data validation tools, predefined
            ontologies, and automated pipelines help address these challenges. Looking ahead, knowledge graphs are
            poised to play a pivotal role in integrating big data and AI into web platforms, ensuring they remain
            intelligent, adaptable, and user-centric. This systematic review underscores their transformative potential
            in building robust and interconnected digital ecosystems.

        <h2>5. Applications of Knowledge Graphs</h2>
        <h4>E-Comerce</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs are transforming e-commerce by enabling personalized recommendations and improving semantic
            search. Knowledge graphs connect products, customer preferences, and historical data, bringing organizations
            together to deliver valid suggestions. A knowledge graph can suggest complementary items—for example, a
            phone case—after a customer purchases a smartphone. They also enhance the supply chain that fulfills
            customer demand. This allows organizations to maintain optimal inventory levels while people enjoy
            fulfilling shopping experiences. The better businesses understand their data, the better their customer
            experiences and operational efficiency will be.
        </p>
        <h4>Healthcare</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs in healthcare contribute greatly to enhancing patient care and promoting research. They
            effectively bring together previously disparate data sets, including but not limited to patient records,
            treatment protocols, and findings from previously conducted research, to provide targeted healthcare
            solutions. For example, a knowledge graph can link symptoms to diagnosis and recommended treatment in order
            to recommend personalized treatments for an individual patient. Furthermore, knowledge graphs help
            researchers find subtle connections between diseases and potential treatments, thereby accelerating drug
            discovery and encouraging innovation in medical research. They help in better decision-making and faster
            progress in the medical sector by providing an almost complete overview of medical data.
        </p>
        <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs are structured, context-rich platforms in AI that are useful for training machine learning
            models. They capture semantic relationships that improve the inference, decision-making, and predictive
            capabilities of AI to a greater extent. Because, a knowledge graph enables a chatbot to understand user
            queries in a better way due to better context behind the words, resulting in more appropriate and accurate
            answers. Furthermore, knowledge graphs are fundamental in AI applications for autonomous decision-making,
            recommendation systems, and natural language processing, where understanding context is of great importance
            to provide actionable and correct solutions.

        <h2>6. Knowledge Graphs in Web Engineering and AI</h2>
        <h4>6.1 How Knowledge Graphs are Used in Web Engineering</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs organize and demonstrate relationships between large amounts of data to develop a coherent
            framework to support web engineering. They enable web systems that are dynamic and robust by integrating
            current data sources with persistent content. One such example includes a knowledge graph in web engineering
            that links product specifications, customer feedback, and inventory statistics for an online marketplace,
            which ensures that disparate data sources are interconnected and keeps the web page current. This becomes
            essential for rapidly changing data on large-scale platforms such as e-commerce websites or content
            aggregation websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            A standout application of knowledge graphs in web engineering is improving navigation and personalization.
            Knowledge graphs, using semantic relationships, provide content customization based on user preferences—the
            building blocks of user-centric websites. For example, browsing history, past purchases, and contextual
            information can be extracted to recommend relevant products or articles. Such personalization, driven by
            knowledge graphs, attracts and satisfies the user. In addition, in web engineering, knowledge graphs power
            semantic search, enabling users to search based on meaning and thus become more intuitive and accurate for
            an overall improved user experience.
        </p>
        <h4>6.2 How Knowledge Graphs Interact with AI</h4>
        <p>
            Knowledge graphs are revolutionizing artificial intelligence with structured, context-rich data to improve
            decision-making and training. Unlike conventional datasets, they describe relationships between different
            data points and allow AI systems to interpret information in a more meaningful way. For example, knowledge
            graphs in recommendation systems improve personalization by matching user preferences with relevant content.
            They also enable contextual understanding essential for natural language processing. One example is teaching
            chatbots the difference between naming a city and a state with a single term, namely “New York.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, knowledge graphs improve AI model training by ensuring data consistency and reducing bias. They
            are used in situations such as finance to correlate market trends with financial indicators and associated
            risks to help decision makers. For autonomous systems, knowledge graphs provide contextual insights that
            fuel real-time decision-making in the flow of activity. As AI evolves, knowledge graphs will remain central
            to developing more intelligent and reliable systems across industries.

        <h2>8. Demo</h2>
        <p>
            The demo shows how to build a knowledge graph using Neo4j and put it to good use. It provides an idea of
            ​​how relationships between entities such as movies, actors, and crew members are defined through ontology
            and taxonomy. The data includes movie credits from a CSV file, it presents data for each cast and crew.
        </p>
        <h4>Ontology and Taxonomy Creation</h4>
        <p>
            An ontology creates a hierarchical structure with classes such as Person, Actor, Crew, and Movie are
            defined, where relationships, such as IS_A, connect these subclasses to their respective superclasses. For
            example, both Actor and Crew can be categorized as subclasses of Person. In addition, departments such as
            Production and Directing within the industry are defined, creating a taxonomy. This underlying structure
            provides semantic context, enabling its logical reasoning in the subsequent knowledge graph.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Integration and Relationship Mapping</h4>
        <p>
            The script takes in cast and crew data and processes it. Nodes are created and relationships are created:
            actors movies ACTED_IN, with details about the character they played. Similarly, some are linked to their
            departments via WORKS_IN and to the movies via WORKED_ON, indicating roles in the making of the movies
            (e.g., director, writer).

        </p>
        <h4>Querying and Insights</h4>
        <p>
            As the knowledge graph is populated, queries are run to demonstrate its usefulness. The printed ontology
            manifests hierarchical relationships such as Actor IS_A Person, while the taxonomy can link crew members to
            their departments; this can then trigger additional queries to see the relationships between the actor and
            crew members, as well as the movies. This means that there could be commands to pull all the actors for a
            movie and identify the crew members by department and by role.
        </p>
        <p>
            This presents a vision of how knowledge graphs allow for structured integration of data and semantic
            knowledge in various applications, especially in entertainment, where relationships between heterogeneous
            entities are of great importance.

            experiences, and reduce problems like redundancy, confusion, and missing data. That’s why knowledge graphs
            remain so important—they’re a powerful tool for managing data in today’s quick-moving, interconnected
            digital
            world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking to the future, it is true that knowledge graphs will only continue to expand in their applications
            for advancements in AI, intelligent systems, and big data solutions.
